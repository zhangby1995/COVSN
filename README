# COVSN

Some attentions:

1. This project is developed at Visual Studio 2013 platform. Other versions of Visual Studio may also be able to build it but not garanteed.

2. CUDA 7.0 is required.

3. Gurobi 6.5 is required.

4. Some models are provided with the suffix of ply. 6 of them are used for the test of different GDSS approaches only and 8 are for the test of different SC approaches. When you test the different SC approaches, it is recommeded that you comment the code of S-GDSS it the main function (line 49 to 53) as it consumes too much time.
